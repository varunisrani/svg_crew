Okay, let's break down this SVG and get it improved!

**1. Structured List of Improvements Made**

*   **Text Centering:**
    *   The testimonial text is now properly centered within the white container. I've adjusted the `x` attribute of the text elements to be centered based on the container's center and also added dy attribute on the `<text>` tag as dy was required.
    *   The author's name is also centered now.
    *   `text-anchor="middle"` is correctly set.

*   **Text Overflow:**
    *   The text content is now wrapped within the container. The width of the container was adjusted to accommodate the full text, and the line breaks were adjusted.
    *   The text is now sized so that it doesn't overflow the container.

*   **Container Size:**
    *   The testimonial box is now adjusted to fit the content.
    *   The box now fits the text content nicely, without excess space, and no overlaps.

*   **Font and Readability:**
    *   The font size of the testimonial text and the author's name is adjusted for better readability. The line height for the testimoial text is also improved.
    *   The font color has sufficient contrast against the white container.
*    **General Layout:**
    *    The elements now have adequate spacing.

*   **SVG Code Structural Issues:**
    *   The `viewBox` attribute is added to make sure the SVG scales correctly, which is crucial for responsiveness.
    * The `preserveAspectRatio` attribute is also added to `xMidYMid meet` to ensure the SVG does not skew.

**2. Visual Impact Assessment**

*   The overall visual appearance is cleaner and more professional.
*   The text is much easier to read.
*   The layout feels more balanced and well-organized.
*   The design is more appealing overall due to the above fixes.

**3. Accessibility Compliance Status**

*   **Contrast:** The text color now has sufficient contrast, making it easier for people with visual impairments to read.
*   **Text Structure:** Text is now more legible and avoids overflows, which improves screen reader experience.
*   **Scalability:** By adding `viewBox`, the SVG now scales correctly, which helps those who need to zoom for better readability.

**4. Enhanced SVG Code**
